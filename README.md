### rebalance portfolio
Files to start rebalancing your own crypto portfolio.  Note: code for API interaction
is designed for Binance.  If you are using a difference exchange, code in 'rebalance.py'
will need to be adjusted accordingly.  All data is stored in a SQL database.


### backtests
Python files used to:
* Retrieve historical price data
* Simulate HODL of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 randomly chosen coins
* Simulate rebalance using coins used for HODL simulations

Also contains historical price data and simulation results.

### working files
Experimental files for testing new ideas/strategies.  Adding TA to rebalancing?
