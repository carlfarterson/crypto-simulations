This repository was used to simulate a HODL strategy and a daily rebalancing strategy to analyze the effectiveness of rebalancing.
Simulations were conducted by randomly selecting a basket of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 coins 1,000 times each and documenting the daily value of the portfolio over the course of one year.

To combat any inherent bias of choosing the date range to simulate, I calculated the difference of the overall crypto market cap from the
first day to the same day a year later.  From there, I chose the date range with the median difference.
