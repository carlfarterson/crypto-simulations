This repository was used to simulate a HODL strategy and a rebalancing strategy to analyze the effectiveness of portfolio rebalancing.
Backtests were conducted by randomly selecting a basket of 5 coins 250 times and recording the value of the portfolio over the course of one year.  The rebalancing strategy was used in several frequencies:

*  Hourly
*  Daily
*  Weekly
*  Monthly
